# C-Project
This project aims to schedule the given movies to maximise the profit of the multiplex mall. 
The priority of a movie is calculated and used to assign the screens to the  movie to generate a schedule for one week. 
This will be done by analysing the number of tickets unbooked and cast weightage, demand score, respectively.
